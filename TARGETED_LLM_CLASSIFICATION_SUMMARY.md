# Targeted LLM Classification Summary

## Overview
Successfully reverted to the Yahoo Finance enrichment process and applied targeted LLM classification only to symbols that needed it.

## Process

### 1. Reverted to Yahoo Finance Data
- Restored `holdings_detailed_20250912_124723.json` which contained the good Yahoo Finance enrichment data
- This file had 95.2% classification success rate with Yahoo Finance

### 2. Identified Unknown Classifications
- Found 5 symbols with both Sector and Issuer_Region as "Unknown"
- Total market value: $310,264.51
- All were ETFs that Yahoo Finance couldn't properly classify

### 3. Applied Targeted LLM Classification
Applied LLM classification only to the 5 symbols that needed it:

| Symbol | Name | Recommended Sector | Recommended Region | Recommended Industry | Confidence |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| ICSH | iShares Ultra Short Duration Bond ETF | Fixed Income | United States | Ultra Short-Term Bond ETF | 95% |

| HYG | iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF | Fixed Income | United States | High Yield Bond ETF | 95% |
